## Title
Analysis of Consensus Protocols in Multi-Agent Networks: Influence of Topology, Noise and Adversaries

## Abstract
(1 paragraph)

## 1. Introduction
- Motivation, link to game theory (short)

## 2. Model and Methods
- Consensus update rules
- Protocols: simple average, Metropolis, gossip
- Topologies tested
- Metrics (range, variance, time-to-consensus)

## 3. Implementation
- short description of MESA implementation, reproducibility

## 4. Experiments and Results
- Plots + discussion:
  - Convergence traces
  - Convergence time vs topology/protocol
  - Noise robustness
  - Stubborn/Byzantine agents (if included)
  - Spectral-gap correlation

## 5. Discussion
- Theoretical interpretation (Î»2)
- Observed behaviours and implications

## 6. Conclusion & future work
- Mechanism design, mean-field, event-triggered updates

## Appendix
- Code snippets and instructions to reproduce
